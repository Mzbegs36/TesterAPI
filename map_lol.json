The map is set up so the two lanes are at the bottom and they’re only separated by some terrain and a thin bush. One player can easily travel between the lanes, ganking and helping out whoever might need it. Simultaneously, the junglers are farming shared XP and gold. While they can also help gank lanes, they’re going to be more focused on farming up and running around the map and helping with events.",
